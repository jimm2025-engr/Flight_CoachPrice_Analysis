# ✈️ Flight Coach Price Analysis

This project explores the distribution of coach flight prices using Python data analysis tools. We visualize price trends and prepare for further statistical modeling and dashboard integration.

## 📊 What’s Inside

- `flight_price_analysis.py`: Script for loading and plotting coach price data
- `flight_price_analysis.ipynb`: (Optional) Notebook for in-depth EDA and modeling
- `dashboard.py`: (Planned) Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration
- `flight.csv`: The dataset containing coach flight prices and additional variables

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `streamlit` (for future dashboard)
- `statsmodels` (planned for regression analysis)

## 📈 Coming Up

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Price prediction model
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit)
- Reporting with Jupyter

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Install requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run analysis:
